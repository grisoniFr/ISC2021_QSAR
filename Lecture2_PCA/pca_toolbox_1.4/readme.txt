PCA toolbox for MATLAB - version 1.4
--------------------------------------------
The PCA toolbox for MATLAB is a collection of MATLAB modules for calculating unsupervised multivariate models for data structure analysis: Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) and Cluster Analysis.

This is the version 1.4 of the PCA toolbox for MATLAB 

PCA toolbox for MATLAB has been released by Milano Chemometrics and QSAR research Group.

INSTALLING THE TOOLBOX
--------------------------------------------
MATLAB should be installed, while the Statistics Toolbox is needed to compute Cluster Analysis and Multidimensional Scaling. In order to install the toolbox, simply copy the files to a folder (e.g. "PCA toolbox for MATLAB"). Then, in order to use it, select the same folder as MATLAB current directory.

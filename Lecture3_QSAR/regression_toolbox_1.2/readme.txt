Regression toolbox for MATLAB - version 1.0
--------------------------------------------
The Regression toolbox for MATLAB is a collection of MATLAB modules for calculating regression multivariate models: Ordinary Least Squares (OLS), Partial Least Squares (PLS), Principal Component Regression (PCR), Ridge regression, local regression based on K Nearest Neighbours (KNN) and Binned Nearest Neighbours (BNN) approaches, and variable selection approaches (Forward selection, Genetic Algorithms and Reshaped Sequential Replacement).

This is the version 1.0 of the Regression toolbox for MATLAB 

Regression toolbox for MATLAB has been released by Milano Chemometrics and QSAR research Group.

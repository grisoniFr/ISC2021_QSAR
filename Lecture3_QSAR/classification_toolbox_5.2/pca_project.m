function [model] = pca_project(Xnew,model)

% project new samples in the PCA model
%
% model = pca_project(Xnew,model);
%
% INPUT:
% Xnew              dataset [samples x variables]
% model             PCA model calculated by means of pca_model
%
% OUTPUT
% model is a structure containing the following fields:
% Tpred             score matrix [samples x num_comp]
% Thot_pred         T2 Hotelling [1 x samples]
% Tcont_pred        T2 Hotelling contributions [samples x variables]
% Qres_pred         Q residuals [1 x samples]
% Qcont_pred        Q residuals contribution [samples x variables]

Classification toolbox for MATLAB - version 5.2
--------------------------------------------
The Classification toolbox for MATLAB is a collection of MATLAB modules for calculating classification (supervised pattern recognition) multivariate models: Discriminant Analysis, Partial Least Square Discriminant Analysis (PLSDA), Classification trees (CART), K-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), class modeling Potential Functions (Kernel Density Estimators), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Unequal class models (UNEQ) and Soft Independent Modeling of Class Analogy (SIMCA).

This is the version 5.2 of the Classification toolbox for MATLAB 

Classification toolbox for MATLAB has been released by Milano Chemometrics and QSAR research Group.

INSTALLING THE TOOLBOX
--------------------------------------------
MATLAB should be installed, while the Statistics Toolbox is needed to compute some of the classification methods (Discriminant Analysis and CART). In order to install the toolbox, simply copy the files to a folder (e.g. "Classification toolbox for MATLAB"). Then, in order to use it, select the same folder as MATLAB current directory.

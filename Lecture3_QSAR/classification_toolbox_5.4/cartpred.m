function pred = cartpred(X,model)

% prediction with classifcation trees (CART)
%
% pred = cartpred(X,model)
%
% INPUT:            
% X                 dataset [samples x variables]
% model             plsda model calculated by means of cartfit
%
% OUTPUT:
% pred is a structure containing the following fields:
% class_pred        predicted class as numerical vector [samples x 1]
% class_pred_string predicted class as string vector {samples x 1}
%                   (available only if model was fitted with the class input vector as a cell array with strings as class labels)
%
% RELATED ROUTINES:
% cartfit           fit CART
% cartcv            cross-validatation of CART
% class_gui         main routine to open the graphical interface

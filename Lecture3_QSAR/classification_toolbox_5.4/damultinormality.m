function distSort = damultinormality(X)

% test for multinormality distribution based on squared generalized distance and chi-square percentiles;
% data are multinormally distributed if:
% 1. a plot of the ordered squared distances and the chi-square percentiles is nearly linear 
% 2. roughly half of the distances are less then or equal to chi-square percentile of 0.5

% distSort = damultinormality(X)
%
% INPUT:
% X                 data [samples x variables]
%
% OUTPUT:
% distSort          table [samples x 3] with:
%                   first column:  ID of samples
%                   second column: sorted squared generalized distances (from minimum to maximum)
%                   third column:  chi-square percentiles, with degree of freedom equal to the number of variables
